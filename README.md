# EldenRingMods for ModEngine2
A collection of mods @techiew made for Elden Ring, now with some minor patches for easier use with [ModEngine2](https://github.com/soulsmods/ModEngine2).

## Installation

It's recommended to extract the binaries you download at the root of your ModEngine2 folder, as the `.log` and `.ini` files are written to and read from there.
Regardless, you can put the `.dll` files anywhere you please, as long as the `external_dlls` in your config points to them.
